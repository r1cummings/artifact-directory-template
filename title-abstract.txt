Title:
Blood-based Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease from miRNA Data

Abstract:
Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that slowly destroys a person's cognitive and physical abilities. The cause of AD is unclear, but is believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Because the only way to definitely diagnose AD is post mortem, the search for earlier definitive detection is crucial. One way of doing this is by analyzing blood samples to detect biomarkers and microRNAs. A biomarker is defined as a characteristic that is objectively measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, while microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in the regulation of gene expression. Recent studies show miRNAs and biomarkers as possible tools for AD diagnosis, thus, leading us to analyze blood miRNA data for our study. Utilizing influences from various other studies, we examined 70 blood samples of AD and controlled patients through our custom genetics pipeline in hopes of a breakthrough in understanding the pathology of the disease. We then implemented two different statistical tests, a non-parametric hypothesis test (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test) and a parametric hypothesis t-test (DESeq2). From these tests we were able to isolate nine significant samples to perform further analysis on its relationship and effect to AD.
